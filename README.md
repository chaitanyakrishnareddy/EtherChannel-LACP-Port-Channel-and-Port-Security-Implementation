EtherChannel (LACP), Port-Channel & Port Security

This project is a focused Layer-2 lab built in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to practice:
- Bundling links with **EtherChannel (LACP / Port-Channel)**
- Trunking over the **Port-Channel**
- Hardening edge ports with **Port Security (sticky MAC, violations)**

> ✅ No routing/DHCP/DNS here—just clean switching concepts.
